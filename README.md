Invades your personal space since Nov 9. 2010

Remember those Windows screen walking animations from the era long gonne? Well back in 2010, while finishing my studies I tried to make one in Java, for Linux. I was procrastinating from doing my final thesis.

Yeah in Java with second to zero system integration... Where I had to take a screenshot and then calculate the position of the window and cut the image and paint it so the window would be transparent... ü§£ Like I didn't have anything better to do.

Well this repo is to commemorate this period of my life, and this silly project, that later led to a Python based project: https://github.com/stamat/droplets

That is all.
